<p style="color:rgba(200, 88, 202, 0.853);"> My name is Christian Macias.</p>

<p> My favorite song is currently <i> There'd Better Be A Mirrorball </i> by <i> Arctic Monkeys. </i> </p>

<p> <br> Testing line breaks, don't think it's working. </br> </p>

<p> A line from the song that sticks out to me is <q> Yesterday still leaking through the roof, but that's nothing new </q> </p>

<h4> I am currently in the middle of a freelance project, was tasked with creating the bars halloween flyer.
     <br> It is Pirates themed and I have to email the creative director to find out if we're going in the same direction </br>
     we went last year for Beetlejuice. It's due Saturday but I procrastinate which means I'll have a  semi finished <br> piece Thursday night.
     Writing this to test out some selectors! </br>

     <br> borders not working at the moment. </br> <br> working now.. kind of? </br>
